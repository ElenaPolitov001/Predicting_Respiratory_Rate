    "This research was the product of a data driven healthcare hackathon I participated sponsored by [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com) and the [School of AI](https://www.theschool.ai/). **I was the team leader, and our team came in first place for the NY division.** Here we use blood oxygen and electrocardiogram data to predict the rate at which people breath. It turns out, this data can be extracted from a smart watch. Using this data, we could predict a persons respiratory rate with 90% accuracy."

    "[Electrocardiogram (ECG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography) data and [photoplethysmogram (PPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram#Photoplethysmograph) data are extremely useful in healthcare. They are used to assist in diagnostic methods for a wide array of diseases. ECG measures cardiac properties and PPG data measures blood oxygen levels using optical instruments. (1,2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both ECG and PPG data can be extracted from a smart watch at the same level of accuracy and precisions of machines found in hospitals. ECG and PPG can be combined to predict breathing rate, and using the combination of all this data (3,4,5).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used for this analysis was not actually collected from a smart watch, but smart watches have the capability to collect the same data. The data used in this analysis was from 53 patients in intensive care, where their ECG, PPG and breathing rates were measured. (4,5,6)\n",

    "In conjunction, it was also our goal to investigate the feasibility of using this type of data for enhancing diagnostic processes in healthcare. We ended by speculating on the market evolution of technology that integrates these methods."
